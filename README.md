# Blockchain-Based Voting System (Solidity)

## 📌 Project Overview

This project is a decentralized voting application developed using Solidity on the Ethereum blockchain. It demonstrates how blockchain technology can be used to create secure, transparent, and tamper-proof election systems.

## 🚀 Key Features

* Smart contract-based voting mechanism
* Transparent and immutable vote recording
* Admin-controlled election process
* Real-time result visibility
* Decentralized architecture

## 🧠 Technologies Used

* Solidity
* Ethereum
* React.js
* Truffle / Ganache
* MetaMask

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. The admin deploys the smart contract.
2. Eligible voters are registered.
3. The election process is started by the admin.
4. Voters cast their votes securely via the blockchain.
5. Once the election ends, results are instantly available.

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes

* Gained hands-on experience with smart contract development
* Understood the fundamentals of decentralized applications (DApps)
* Learned how blockchain ensures transparency and security
* Explored wallet integration using MetaMask



 This project was developed as part of my learning journey in Blockchain technology.
